# vidiq-coding-interview-project

Welcome to the vidIQ coding interview project! 🧑‍💻

This codebase will format and lint code automatically and includes a REST API that provides keyword data. It is built with Next.js, Tailwind, and Jest, and the code is written in TypeScript.

During your interview, you will be asked to share your screen, so please clone this repo and get it running locally. We will focus on implementing a few features together, adding some tests, and discussing other improvements and concepts. You may search the Internet and use whichever 3rd-party libraries you prefer. Even Copilot is fair game! 🤖

## Getting started

Please install Node and Yarn on your machine.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Serve the app
yarn dev

# Run tests
yarn test:watch
```
